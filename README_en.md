HYPERLUNATIC is an open-source learning archive of game project backups, created by AlbedoHummingbird (317gw) and developed using Godot Engine.

## 🚀Getting Started
The engine version aggressively follows the latest stable release — Godot_4.4-stable  
Development is primarily done using GDScript.

Build versions are categorized as dev, alpha, beta, and stable.  
Distribution names follow the format: "HYPERLUNATIC v0.1.0-dev.1.20250708".  
Internal version in application/config/version uses the format: "v0.1.0-dev.1".

Currently, all released versions are development (dev) builds, so exporting the game at this stage has limited utility. Launch the game via "HYPERLUNATIC.exe".

To edit the project: download the source code ZIP from the <font color = green><>Code▽</font> button above, or clone the repository. Install [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/) yourself, import the project files, and explore freely! 😊

In rare cases, if you encounter installation errors or missing dependencies, I'm afraid I don't have solutions either. 🤷

Hey! You can contribute right now! Map design, easter eggs, mini-games, ARG elements...  
All designs are work-in-progress. Who knows what might happen next—probability and statistics might have something to say.  

 * See [TodoPlan](TodoPlan.md) for future plans.


## 🪪Introduction:
This is an open-source *head-view* 3D game featuring platforming, adventure puzzles, action shooting, and danmaku dodging. Explore the maps to discover what needs to be accomplished.

> Or perhaps just observe the world you're in...

#### 📜Story
In 2077, Karole Kate returns to her hometown on vacation. While sorting through her old computer, she discovers that one of the servers for a *super old* game she used to play is still online. After tinkering with hardware, software, upgrades, modifications, and installing mods, she logs into this server—a server that was first planned back in 2000.  
And for the record: she's playing a game, not time-traveling. 😡

 * #### 🗺Map Design & Game Flow
A cosmic journey from Earth🌏 to the Sun☀️! Or perhaps a nod to Dante's Divine Comedy?  
Regions differentiate scene styles and gameplay—such as the sky, Moon, and Mercury.

Gameplay takes place within "game servers" (which are actually offline). Internally, it uses a route-based level system. Scene components like invisible walls, play areas, and collision boxes are clearly defined.  
Background models in scenes are complete and fully accessible.

Subtle connections exist between game servers. You can switch between them by falling off the map or finding deliberate teleport points.  
Level selection is also available via the main menu, disguised as a game server list.

Beyond the main storyline, there are challenge missions with clear rule restrictions. Achievement progress reflects overall progression. Puzzles are intertwined with levels, servers, challenges, and achievements. Unnecessary ARG elements (not yet implemented).

 * #### 🖼Graphics
The atmosphere of an old game server room with modded aesthetics. Not cyberpunk.  
Features low-resolution textures, low-poly models, selective use of PBR materials based on object properties, minimalist lighting, and尽可能 impressive shader post-processing.

You'll be able to see your own body! (Sorry, not yet implemented)

 * #### Primary Gameplay References (highly recommended)
ULTRAKILL, Celeste, Mirror's Edge, Garry's Mod, Half-Life 2, Neon White, VOIN, Touhou Project, Minecraft, Touhou Luna Nights, 沙雕之路, Deadlock, DEATH STRANDING DIRECTOR'S CUT, Antimatter Dimensions, NGU IDLE  
...and other great games.

Style inspiration comes from the Source Engine (primarily GMod) and Minecraft servers.

Note: All the above concepts are still in development.


## 🛠️Core Mechanics
The core mechanics of HYPERLUNATIC provide insight into the game's design.

* #### Player Movement
    While referencing the Source Engine, the player's basic passive physics and movement don't fully mimic rigid bodies—concise physics simulations aren't used in the code.  
    The movement system is complex, with code handling different behaviors based on the player's environment and state.  
    Surfaces like ice calculate friction coefficients.  
    Slopes cause sliding—this system sometimes makes players accelerate and launch when stepping off edges.  
    When climbing slopes, incorrect stair detection can make the player's apparent speed increase continuously without actual acceleration.

* #### Physics Interactions
    Physical effects are replicated as accurately as possible for various objects, without excessive physical visual effects like wind, water ripples, or moving leaves/grass.

* #### Danmaku Hell
    Redesigned with reference to Touhou Project's danmaku patterns—2D danmaku designs aren't suitable for 3D gameplay.

* #### Level Selection Interface
    Wrapped in a game server interface.

* #### Progression Control
    Area: Style definition # Groups content by theme and visual style (not actual play scene division). Most game servers belong to one area.  
    Game Server: Scene container # Complete level scene with one or multiple routes.  
    Route: Game path # Specific path from start to finish, marked by checkpoints and an endpoint. Triggers scene transitions. Essentially a level.  
    Scene Components: Interactive elements # Environmental objects, interactive elements, and game mechanics.

* #### Current Status
    Water physics performance is poor, and objects struggle to stabilize on water surfaces. Enable water physics in the level_001_test_sandbox main scene by toggling use_rigid_bodys_fluid_mechanic in res://assets/systems/water_physics/fluid_mechanics_manager.tscn.  
    Since the project is in development, optimization is limited. If experiencing lag, reduce the number of rigid bodies or other objects in the scene.  
    The danmaku system framework is in progress—behavior scripts can't be written properly yet, and performance is poor. It's recommended to limit bullets to under 1000 per scene. Future optimization will use 2D spatial physics for relative danmaku planes.  
    Object pooling isn't implemented yet—previous attempts to use it for danmaku actually caused more lag.  
    Occasional bug-like rollback phenomena may occur.  


## Q&A:
* Why use Godot for 3D game development?
    * Godot is lightweight with low disk/memory usage, fast startup/shutdown, minimal system load, and easy development. Advanced features of other engines aren't a priority.

* What can I do to contribute?
    * Many ways: submit code, report bugs, provide suggestions, translate documents, etc.

* I want to help!
    * Use this GitHub repository or leave messages in the contact information below to discuss.

* Multi-language support?
    * Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese, and English. No plans for other languages yet. If you'd like to create translations, please contact me directly.

* Release platforms?
    * Currently: PC (Steam, itch.io)

* How long will development take?
    * I'd like to develop it full-time, but challenges exist. Anyway, coming s∞n in 2077.

* Why 2077?
    * It's a common year in cyberpunk and futuristic works.

* What's the gameplay like? It sounds like a mix of many games.
    * Core gameplay draws from Celeste's platforming and ULTRAKILL's fast-paced action. Map design references Celeste and Neon White. Feel and impression matter most—mechanics aren't randomly combined.  
    * Just explore.

* I don't see any characters?
    * Gameplay is player-centric with light storytelling. Characters will likely come from my novels, tabletop RPGs, and RimWorld—mostly female, inspired by Touhou Project.

* What's the Chinese translation of HYPERLUNATIC?
    * ~~亢奋的疯子~~ ~~超月狂~~ ~~超级月亮人~~ No suitable Chinese translation exists. HYPERLUNATIC works as the sole name. Suggestions are welcome!

* Antimatter Dimensions and NGU IDLE are idle/clicker games—how do they relate?
    * Their progression design is excellent, and some puzzle elements are fascinating—so I "borrowed" ideas from them.

* ?:
    * Promise me you'll sleep well.
