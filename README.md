# HYPERLUNATIC
HYPERLUNATIC项目备份存档开源学习文件，由317gw制作，Godot Engine 4.3.stable开发。
如发现bug请联系317gw。

项目根目录下，目前只有assets文件夹能确保为项目作者（317gw）制作的主要原创部分。
“主要原创”的意思是部分代码和资源文件、图像、音频来自网络，对齐进行了修改，并尽可能的表明了出处，未标明的可自行搜索和进行补全。

根目录下的其他并非由Godot Engine或其addon生成文件和文件夹，为临时的流动文件，其来源为其他开源项目或互联网，用于测试、开发等。
如有对其他开源项目、addon、互联网资源的使用许可或许可证的异议，可能为项目作者的疏忽，请联系项目作者。

addons文件夹下存放着Godot Engine的插件。
插件的原作者并非项目作者，部分代码已根据项目需求进行了修改。
如有问题，请联系项目作者。



HYPERLUNATIC project backup archive open source learning file made by 317gw, Godot Engine 4.3.stable development.
Please contact 317gw if you find bugs.

In the root directory of the project, 
only the assets folder is currently guaranteed to be the main original parts made by the project author (317gw).

The term ‘mainly original’ means that some code and resource files, images, and audio were taken from the web, modified, and wherever possible, 
the source is indicated, but if it's not, you can search for it and complete it yourself.

Other files and folders in the root directory that are not generated by Godot Engine or its addon are temporary flow files 
sourced from other open source projects or the Internet for testing, development, and so on.

Please contact the authors of the project if you have any objections to the licences or permits
for the use of other open source projects, addons, or Internet sources, 
which may be an oversight by the authors of the project.


The addons folder holds the Godot Engine addon.
The original author of the addon is not the project author, 
and some of the code has been modified to meet the needs of the project.
If you have any questions, please contact the project author.
