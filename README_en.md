#### üìùDescription:
*The text is translated by ai
Head person parkour exploration bullet-hell game, by White Hummingbird, Godot Engine Development
HYPERLUNATIC is a backup archive and open-source learning project for the game, created by AlbedoHummingbird (317gw) and developed using the Godot Engine.

#### üì¶Getting Started:
The engine version will aggressively follow the latest stable release ‚Äî Godot_4.4-stable.

At this stage, exporting the game is not meaningful. Please download the source code ZIP from the green `< >Code‚ñΩ` button above, install [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/), import the project files, and then go wild :)

All designs are under construction. Check out probability and statistics‚Äîwho knows what might happen next.

Hey! You can join in right now! Map design, easter eggs, mini-games, ARGs, etc.

#### ü™™Introduction:
This is an open-source *first-person* 3D game featuring platform jumping, adventure puzzles, action shooting, bullet hell dodging, and more. Explore the map to find out what needs to be done.

> Or take a look at the world around you...

###### üé¶Story:
In 2077, Karole Kate returns to her hometown for vacation. While sorting through an old computer, she discovers that one of the servers for a *super old* game she used to play is still online. After some hardware and software upgrades, modifications, and tweaks, she enters this server‚Äîoriginally planned in the year 2000.

###### üó∫Map Design:
A cosmic journey from Earth üåè to the Sun ‚òÄÔ∏è! Or perhaps Dante's Divine Comedy?

Regions are used to differentiate scene styles and gameplay mechanics. Internally, regions adopt a linear level design with clear boundaries, such as invisible walls, playable areas, and collision boxes. The background models in scenes are complete and accessible. Levels and regions are connected in subtle ways, allowing transitions by falling off the map or finding intentional teleport points. Compatible with a main menu level selection system.

###### üõ£Gameplay Flow:
In addition to completing level objectives, the game includes challenge tasks with specific rule restrictions. Achievement progress reflects gameplay progress. Puzzles are intertwined with levels, regions, challenges, and achievements. Optional ARG elements (not yet implemented).

###### üñºVisuals:
You can see your own body! (Not implemented yet, sorry.)

The old server's rooms evoke the atmosphere of an ancient game with modern visual enhancements. Features low-resolution textures, selective PBR materials based on object properties, essential and minimalist lighting effects, and special shader visuals.

#### Q&A:
* Why Use Godot for 3D Game Development?
  * Godot is lightweight, with low disk and memory usage, fast startup, and minimal system burden, making development easier. Other engines' advanced technologies are not yet considered.

* How Can I Contribute?
  * Many ways: submit code, report bugs, suggest ideas, translate docs, etc.

* I Want to Help!
  * Use this GitHub repo or leave a message via the contact info below ‚Üì.

* Multilingual Support?
  * Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese, English. No capacity for other languages yet. If you'd like to contribute translations, contact me.

* Platforms?
  * Currently, PC only (Steam, itch.io).

* How Long Will Development Take?
  * I'd like to develop full-time, but it's challenging. Coming s‚àûn in 2077.

* Why 2077?
  * Because many cyberpunk or futuristic works reference this year.

* What's the Gameplay? A Frankenstein of Games?
  * Mainly inspired by Celeste's platforming and ULTRAKILL's fast-paced action. Map design draws from Celeste and Neon White. Feel and impression matter more‚Äîno mismatched mechanics.
  * Just explore.

* Where Are the Characters?
  * The game focuses on the player, with minimal story. Might include characters from my novels, RimWorld, etc., likely female (because Touhou Project).

* Antimatter Dimensions and NGU IDLE are idle games‚Äîhow are they related?
  * Their progression design is excellent, and some puzzles are fun, so I borrowed ideas.

* ?:
  * Promise me you'll sleep well.
